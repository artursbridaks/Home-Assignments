**Description**

Exercise 1: maxProfit

* The max value of the 'price' column is determined
* An array till that place is selected
* Total sum of purchased items calculated
* The profit then is calculated by subtracting the sum of all deals from total purchases


Exercise 2: stringCost

* A simple, built-in function can be used to calculate the correct answer.
* While I'm fully aware that this might not be the best solution for hundreds of inputs,
it passed the given criteria and thus is better answer than no answer at all.

Exercise 3: longestSubstr

* First the given array values are sorted from lowest to highest
* A for loop iterates through the array and a median is calculated

**Commentary**

The hardest task was "Exercise 1 - maxProfit".
At first the task was overwhelming and hard to digest. Did a lot of tests till I got it right.
The most time-consuming exercise was "Exercise 2 - stringCost". After many tests and research, I
found that a built-in function can be used to pass the tests. Opting out for that was more efficient than
leaving the exercise unsolved.
If I was given more time for the tasks, I would optimise the code even more and find better solutions.
