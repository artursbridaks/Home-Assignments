**Instructions:**

To run the "solutions.php" file, open the file through a suitable software.
PHPStorm command - php solutions.php

**Description**

Exercise 1: findOddEvenPair

* Iterating through $numbers array
* An if statement determines the parity between the numbers
* The function outputs the array key through a built in function array_search

Exercise 2: SummationService

* A non-empty array is passed into the constructor
* Two non-negative numbers are passed into the function
* A simple built in function (array_sum) completes the task

Exercise 3: longestSubstr

* An empty array is created which will later hold the substrings of the given input
* The given string is separated in pairs of two and are pushed into $subStrings array
* The next for loop and if statement determines at which point to stop
* The result is returned by the function

**Commentary**

The hardest and the most time-consuming exercise was "Exercise 3 - longestSubstr".
There definitely is more room for improvement since, for example, 
the third task took me more time to solve than it would be given in a real life interview.   
The current version of the solution might not be capable of passing hundreds of tests.
